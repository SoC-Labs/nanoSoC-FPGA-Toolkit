# fpga/hooks/pre_synth.tcl - DID THE PARAMETER YOU DECLARED ACTUALLY REACH THE
#                            DESIGN THE TOOL IS ABOUT TO SYNTHESISE?
#
# A WORKING CHECK, NOT AN ILLUSTRATION. It asserts nothing until this project
# declares RTL_ASSERT_TABLE, and until then it REFUSES THE STAGE and says how to
# fix that - every run, in the log, in words. "We did not check" and "we checked
# and it was clean" must never read alike, and an unconfigured hook that passed
# quietly would be the second one wearing the first one's face.
#
# If @BLOCK@ has nothing to assert here, DELETE THIS FILE. That is the honest
# way to say so and nothing else breaks.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHERE THIS RUNS
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   Sourced by `flow_hook pre_synth`, whose machinery is
#   $(FPGA_FLOW_DIR)/flow/common/flow_utils.tcl - `proc flow_hook`, line 492
#   when this template was written; line 505 sources this file inside a catch
#   that names it and re-raises, line 517 records `pre_synth(<n>s)` in the
#   stage manifest.
#
#   THE CALL SITE IS flow/vivado/4_synth.tcl AND AT THE TIME OF WRITING THAT
#   FILE DOES NOT EXIST. This toolkit is at phase 1: the contract layer is
#   built and no EDA tool is launched by anything in it, so flow/vivado/ is an
#   empty directory and `make synth` fails with "stage 'synth' has no script".
#   The seam is contracted; the stage that fires it is not written. Do not take
#   the ordering below on trust - when the stage lands, read it:
#
#       grep -n 'flow_hook pre_synth' $(FPGA_FLOW_DIR)/flow/vivado/*.tcl
#
#   WHAT HAS HAPPENED BY THEN, and what this check depends on:
#     - flow_boot has run. The part and board packs are loaded, the four run
#       directories exist, $REPORT_DIR is writable, $block_name is set.
#     - the sources are READ - the flist stage wrote $WORK_DIR/sources.tcl and
#       the synth stage has consumed it - so the fileset carries whatever
#       generics and defines the flow applied to it.
#     - IP packaging, if this design packages IP, is ALREADY DONE. It is an
#       earlier stage (package-ip) and it is where the defect below happens.
#
#   WHAT HAS NOT HAPPENED:
#     - nothing is elaborated. There is no netlist, no cell, no primitive, and
#       no question about them can be asked here. That is `post_synth`.
#     - synth_design has not run. Everything this hook reads is INPUT.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY THIS EXISTS - A MEASURED DEFECT, WITH THE NUMBER THAT PROVED IT
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   `ipx::package_project` DROPS FILESET DEFINES, by three separate routes, and
#   none of them warn. In this codebase an `ifdef TIDELINK_USE_IDELAY` opt-in
#   was therefore false in EVERY FPGA build - the builds that opted in and the
#   builds that did not. It was found by building both and discovering the
#   "IDELAY-off" bitstream was BYTE-IDENTICAL to the "IDELAY-on" one: the
#   primitive was absent from every build that believed it had it, for months,
#   with the tool reporting nothing, ever.
#
#   Two consequences, and this file is the first of them:
#
#     RTL_PARAMS IS THE PRIMARY MECHANISM. Parameters survive packaging as
#     CONFIG.* properties on the IP; defines do not. Prefer a module parameter
#     over a macro for anything that selects behaviour.
#
#     AND THE SECOND HALF OF THE SAME LESSON: this codebase has ZERO
#     occurrences of `ifdef FPGA` and `ifdef ASIC` across 13,524 RTL files,
#     along with XILINX, VIVADO, SIMULATION and FPGA_ONLY. A flow that
#     configures the build with +define+FPGA CONFIGURES NOTHING. Selection here
#     is by FLIST FILE-SWAP (same module name, opposite directory) and by
#     MODULE PARAMETER.
#
#   So the question this hook answers is not "did I write it in design.mk" -
#   you can read that. It is "is it still there, in the tool, on the fileset
#   that is about to be synthesised, AFTER everything the flow did to get here".
#
#   ITS OTHER HALF IS fpga/hooks/post_impl.tcl, which counts the primitives the
#   opt-in was supposed to produce. This one proves the tool was TOLD. That one
#   proves it HAPPENED. Neither substitutes for the other: a define can reach
#   the fileset and be read by no file, and a primitive can appear for a reason
#   nobody declared.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# HOW TO CONFIGURE IT
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   Declare RTL_ASSERT_TABLE - either as an exported make variable in
#   fpga/design.mk (beside the other gates in section 12), or as a Tcl global
#   set by an earlier hook or a step override. The global wins; both spellings
#   are RTL_ASSERT_TABLE, so a message can name one variable and mean both.
#
#   ONE TABLE PER SEAM, WHEN THE SEAMS ASK DIFFERENT QUESTIONS.
#   RTL_ASSERT_TABLE_<SEAM> - RTL_ASSERT_TABLE_POST_BD, RTL_ASSERT_TABLE_PRE_SYNTH
#   - is read first and RTL_ASSERT_TABLE is the fallback for every seam that has
#   no table of its own. This exists because a row is not evaluable everywhere:
#   an `ip` row naming a block-design cell can only be answered where a block
#   design is open, and a `define` row can only be answered where the synthesis
#   fileset exists. One shared table made whichever seam ran first refuse on the
#   other seam's row. The variable actually used is printed and lands in the
#   record as `table_variable`.
#
#   ONE ROW PER EXPECTATION. Fill in the two markers below and delete this
#   commented block once the real declaration is in design.mk - `make check`
#   greps for the markers and they are how a fresh scaffold reports that this
#   decision is still outstanding.
#
#     export RTL_ASSERT_TABLE := \
#         {name <<FILL IN: the parameter or macro, as the RTL spells it>> \
#          kind param \
#          value <<FILL IN: the value it must have in this build>> \
#          why "what breaks silently if this is wrong"}
#
#   KEYS. An UNKNOWN KEY IS FATAL, not ignored: an expectation nothing reads is
#   worse than no expectation at all, because it looks like cover.
#
#     name    REQUIRED  the parameter or macro name, as the RTL spells it
#     kind    param | define                                  (default param)
#     value   the value it must hold. Omit to assert PRESENCE ONLY, which is a
#             weaker claim and is reported as such
#     expect  present | absent                              (default present)
#             `absent` is how RTL_DEFINES_NEVER is enforced - an ASIC-only
#             macro reaching an FPGA build swaps a memory wrapper for one that
#             instantiates a foundry macro the fabric does not have, and the
#             failure is a black box in the netlist rather than an error
#     ip      an IP instance name, or a BLOCK-DESIGN CELL name. Reads
#             CONFIG.<name> on that object instead of the fileset property - the
#             mechanism that SURVIVES packaging, so this is the strong form of
#             the assertion in a packaged flow.
#
#             IT NEEDS A SEAM WHERE THAT OBJECT EXISTS, and in a checkpoint flow
#             pre_synth is not one: measured 2026-09-08, `get_ips` returns
#             NOTHING at that seam on a block-design design, because the BD's IP
#             objects belong to the project the bd stage built and this session
#             only read the design back out of it. The lookup tries, in order,
#             `get_ips <name>`, the BD-qualified `get_ips *_<name>_*` (an IP
#             inside a block design is named <bd>_<cell>_<n>), and
#             `get_bd_cells /<name>`; when none of them answers it refuses and
#             names the seam. A row with an `ip` key on a BD cell belongs in
#             RTL_ASSERT_TABLE_POST_BD, at fpga/hooks/post_bd.tcl.
#     why     free text. Printed and recorded. Write it: a row whose reason is
#             not written down is a row the next person deletes to get a build
#
#   Two rows for one (kind, name) are fatal - the second would silently win.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CHECK
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   * THAT ANY RTL FILE READS THE MACRO. It cannot, here: nothing is elaborated
#     and a `define` is a property of the fileset, not of the design. Given
#     that this codebase has zero `ifdef` of the usual names, a green row for a
#     define means THE TOOL WAS TOLD and nothing more. The strong form of that
#     assertion is a parameter (visible in the report, in the BD, and in the
#     netlist) plus post_impl.tcl counting what it produced.
#   * THAT THE VALUE IS LEGAL for the module, or that it is the value the
#     module's own default would have been. Vivado does not normalise the
#     spelling, so `1`, `1'b1` and `32'd1` are three different strings and this
#     compares strings.
#   * PER-FILE defines, and anything applied inside a packaged IP that the row
#     did not name with `ip`.
#   * ANYTHING IN A SESSION WITH NO SOURCE FILESET. Generics and defines are
#     arguments to synth_design; the fileset properties this hook reads are a
#     second copy of them, and where there is no fileset there is nothing to
#     query. It refuses rather than reporting a clean sheet it did not read.
#     (This used to say "anything in direct mode". That was wrong, and measured
#     wrong: the synthesis stage opens `create_project -in_memory` before it
#     reads a source, because an IP resolves against the part that is set when
#     it is read - and an in-memory project HAS a sources_1 fileset carrying
#     GENERIC and VERILOG_DEFINE. The test is whether a fileset is there, never
#     which mode the run declared.)
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# HOW TO REPRODUCE THE MEASUREMENT WITHOUT RUNNING A STAGE
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   The declared side needs no tool at all:
#
#       make env | grep -E 'RTL_(PARAMS|DEFINES)'
#
#   The tool side needs a Vivado session and the project this flow built:
#
#       vivado -mode batch -source /dev/stdin <<'EOF'
#       open_project build/<run tag>/work/<project>.xpr
#       puts "generic: [get_property GENERIC        [current_fileset]]"
#       puts "define : [get_property VERILOG_DEFINE [current_fileset]]"
#       EOF
#
#   And the record this hook leaves, which is collected with the run:
#
#       $REPORT_DIR/rtl_assert_pre_synth.txt

#
# ::RTL_ASSERT_SEAM OVERRIDES IT, and that is the OTHER way to run this check at
# a second seam - a three-line hook that sets the variable and sources this file,
# instead of a copy of it. Added 2026-09-08 because the copy is 700 lines and
# two copies of a check drift: the one that is wrong is always the one you are
# not reading. The name still has to BE a seam - flow_utils.tcl's
# flow_seam_assert refuses anything else - so this cannot invent a point that

# read at two seams cannot be right at both: a row whose `ip` key names a block
# design cell can only be evaluated where a block design is open (post_bd), and
# a row about a synthesis define can only be evaluated where the synthesis
# fileset exists (pre_synth). Sharing one table made whichever seam ran first
# refuse on the other seam's row.

#     RTL_ASSERT_TABLE          every seam that has no table of its own

# never has to work out which of the two was in force.

# WHAT WENT WRONG. The row said `ip nanosoc_eth_chiplet_0` - the name the block
# design gives the cell - and the hook refused: "row names ip
# 'nanosoc_eth_chiplet_0', which is not in this project". Correcting it to the
# Vivado IP object's real name, tidelink_design_nanosoc_eth_chiplet_0_0, refused
# identically, because at the pre_synth seam of a checkpoint flow `get_ips`
# returns NOTHING AT ALL: the block design's IP objects live in the separate
# project the bd stage built, and this session read the design back from it.
#
# So the key is not "unusable for BD designs" - it is answerable at a DIFFERENT
# SEAM, and it now looks in all three places an answer can be, in the order that
# makes the strongest claim first:
#
#   1. get_ips <name>          an IP instance named exactly as the row spells it
#   2. get_ips *_<name>_*      the BD-QUALIFIED spelling. An IP instantiated
#                              inside a block design is named <bd>_<cell>_<n>,
#                              so the cell name the project author knows is a
#                              substring of the object name and never equal to
#                              it. Ambiguity here is FATAL, not a guess.
#   3. get_bd_cells /<name>    the block-design cell itself, which is where the
#                              value is SET (`set_property CONFIG.<x> {v}` in
#                              the BD Tcl) and is answerable at post_bd.
#
# WHEN NONE OF THEM ANSWERS the refusal names the seam and says which seam can:
# a row about an object that is not there cannot pass or fail honestly, and a
# message that only says "not in this project" sends the reader to check a name
# that was never the problem.
